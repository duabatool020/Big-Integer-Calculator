# Big-Integer-Calculator
The hardware of most computers allows integers of only a specific maximum length.<br>
Suppose we want to store and manipulate integers of arbitrary lengths (containing
hundreds of digits).<br>
In order to solve this problem using C++, you are required to do the following:<br>
ï‚· Design an appropriate data structure to store BiG Integers (both positive and
negative)<br>
Implement the following operations on BiG Integers:<br>
Addition<br>
Subtraction<br>
Multiplication<br>
Division<br>
